Hi, I’m Jasmine,


I’m interested in moving up in IT. Looking forward to get an entry level position in Help Desk Tier 2 or up, IT Network, IT Security,  . I will be doing multiple projects related to job roles Systems Analyst, Network Analyst, and Cybersecurity Analyst. Even though these projects will be documented in Github, everyday I'll be practicing what I learn. Also test ideas I may think of. Practice makes perfect to become proficient. I’m currently learning THM Complete Beginner Path and SOC Level 1. Including the Projects below. Certifications: Currently studying for CySA+.
