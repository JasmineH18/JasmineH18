Hi, I’m Jasmine,


I’m interested in Cybersecurity and looking forward to get an entry level position for it. I will be doing multiple projects related to job roles Systems Analyst, Network Analyst, and Cybersecurity Analyst. Even though these projects will be documented in Github, everyday I'll be practicing what I learn. Also test ideas I may think of. Practice makes perfect to become proficient. I’m currently learning THM Complete Beginner Path/SOC Level 1 and Qualys Endpoint Detection and Response. Including the Projects below.
